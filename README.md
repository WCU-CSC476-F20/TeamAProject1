Crazy Labyrinth
A game all about getting the ball in the right hole!

Players use WASD to tilt the stage in order to traverse a diverse field of mazes designed and created in house.

Users are greeted with a beautiful introduction screen, with professional looking textures. 
In order to advance, Players must dodge the black holes to get to the space warp at the end of the level.

Throughout their playthrough of the game, players will be notified whenever they achieve a top score.
In addition to that, players will have the opportunity to try and best the fastest times on each course.
Players will have to navigate dangerous terrain to accomplish their goal of ending in the right hole.

Some levels will test a player's commitment to the goal, while others will test a player's patience to achieve the goal.
Sometimes a level will become very disorienting due to the amount of necessary rotations, 
and for that we have added the option to reset the current level in the middle of a run.

At the end of the game players will be met with a simple Game Over screen that tells them of their accomplishments throughout the game, 
such as total time spent to beat the entire game, lives lost, and number of records beaten.
